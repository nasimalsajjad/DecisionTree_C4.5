# DecisionTree_C4.5

Using c4.5 algorithm, this is a decision tree from scratch in Python. A set of training data is used to build the model. 
Steps and algorithm to build the model is given in DecisionTreeC4.5.ppt file. This model is developed by calculating:
Entropy, Information Gain, Gain Ratio. Then based on maximum gain ration the first feature to split was selected.
After that same steps have been done to grow the whole tree. Decision tree pruning technique was also used.
